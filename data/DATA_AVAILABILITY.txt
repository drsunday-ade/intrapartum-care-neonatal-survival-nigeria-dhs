This repository contains code and documentation for analyses based on the 2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) Births Recode data. The underlying microdata are not included in this GitHub repository.

In accordance with:

The DHS Program Terms of Use and signed data-use agreement, and

Standard data privacy and research ethics requirements,

we are not permitted to redistribute the DHS microdata or any file containing individual-level DHS records on public platforms such as GitHub. For this reason, the files listed above are referenced by the analysis code but not stored in this repository.
